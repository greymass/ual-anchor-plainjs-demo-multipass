### ual-anchor-plainjs-demo-multipass

This demo is a developer focused example to help show how UAL (ual-reactjs-renderer) can be used to create a multi-wallet, multi-chain, multi-account, multi-device EOSIO applications.

```
yarn install --frozen-lockfile
yarn start
```

The demo will launch in your browser in a local server.

#### Documentation

The code itself is documented and the bulk of the implementation can be found inside `./src/App.js`. If you read through this code, you should be able to understand exactly how to instantiate anchor-link with the browser transport, and create ESR protocol requests.

#### Signature Provider Support

This demo has been confirmed to work with:

- Anchor Desktop (1.0.0): https://github.com/greymass/anchor
- Anchor Mobile (0.1.0): Unreleased, beta testing in progress.

It should work with any signature provider/wallet that integrates with the ESR Protocol specification.

#### Testnet Support

The current test networks are defined in `./src/assets/blockchain.json`. Additional networks can be enabled by adding new definitions to this file.

The logos for each network are also located in `./src/assets`, and are defined in `./src/Blockchains.js`.
